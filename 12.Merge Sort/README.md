# Merget Sort

> Before start learn `Merge Sort`, let's take a look log(n)
In the computer science, log(n) is relevant to **Divide and conqure**

### Divide and conqure
- Take a bigger problem and divide into smaller problems, do it again, repeat process.
- Repeat down to smallest problems possible, solve them and work your way back toward the larger problem.

Devide and conqure, in binary terms, or dividing in half at each step
- Take a bigger item and divide by 2, next step dividing those items by 2, repeat process
- Repeat down to smallest items possible, perform whatever function you are looking to perform on the smallest items and work your way back toward the larger item

> Where this approach used?
    - Sorting algorithm
    - Searching algorithm
    - Map - directions - take entire travel path, break it down to smaller travel paths and come up with fastest path
    - Web server load - divide the load into multiple servers and service the requests

> log2(n) = x 
    - x: Can be expressed as time, or complexity, number of steps/operations
