# Classes and objects - an introductory look

1. Everything in python is an object
   - Strings, Intergers, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets, functions etc...

2. We can create our own custom objects
   - If an existsing type is not adequate for our need, build our own using `Classes`

3. Functions associated with instance of Object are Known as methods

4. OOP(Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm
   
   1) Uses inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and more
   2) Used extensively in software development
   3) Clean, efficient way of packaging, reusing and maintaining code
   4) Through coving custom objects, we can learn creation of classes and methods, which are basic of all OOP
   5) Can use Inheritance and subclasses
