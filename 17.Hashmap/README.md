# Hashmaps and O(1) search complexity

### What is a hashmap in python?

Hashmap is a type of data structure that maps keys to its value pairs(implement abstaract array data types).

It basically makes use of a function that computes an index value that in turn holds the elements to be searched, inserted, removed, etc

In general, hash tables store key-value pairs and the key is generated using a hash function. 

Hash maps in Python are implemented throught the built-in `dictionary` data type. The keys of dictionary in Python are generated by a hashing function. The elements of a dictionary are not ordered and they can be changed. 

### Hash Table vs Hashmap : Differnece between Has Table and Hashamp in python


| **Hash Table** | **Hash map**| 
|:--- | :--- | 
|  Synchronized | Non-Synchronized | 
| Fast | Slow | 
| Allows one null key and more than one null values | Does not allows null keys or values |
