# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a data structure that stores items in an Last-In/First-Out manner. This is frequently referred to as LIFO. This is in contrast to a queue, which stores items in a First-In/First-Out (FIFO) manner.

The stack is very similar to Linked lists. It just vertically listed list.
