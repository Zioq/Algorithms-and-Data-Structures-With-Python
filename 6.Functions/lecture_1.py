[Structure of functions]

def name_of_func():
    code to perform function operations
    bust be indented to be considered
    part of the function


1. May or may not include parameters
2. Might have return value specified, otherwise returns None by default
3. Good to include a docstring in the function to provice information about it (optional)
 ex)
 def say_hello():
     ```This function prints hello world```
     print("Hello World")

4. Try to limit a function to perform only 1 defiend function, for example: an add function should only perform addition, not addition and multiplication

5. Functions can return mutiple values (as tuples) 
 ex)
 def ints_and_dict(some_parameters):
     ```
     This functions performs some operation
     and returns the integer list and a dictionary
     as output of the operation
     ```
     some function code
     return ints_list, custom_dict
